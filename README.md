# Breast Tissue MLP Classifier

The goals of the project are to perform a preliminary analysis on the received dataset and then to design and optimize a simple MLP neural network for classifying breast tissue samples into proper tissue type classes (adipose, carcinoma, connective, fibro-adenoma, glandular, mastopathy).

The implemented neural network awaits further optimizations.

The dataset analysis as well as MLP network implementation has been done using Python 3.9 with the use of following packages:
- [NumPy 1.22.3](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/1.22.3/)
- [pandas 1.4.2](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/1.4.2/)
- [scikit-learn 1.0.2](https://pypi.org/project/scikit-learn/1.0.2/)
- [matplotlib 3.5.2](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/3.5.2/)
- [seaborn 0.11.2](https://pypi.org/project/seaborn/0.11.2/)
